Joseph implemented the minimax / alpha-beta pruning section of the code, while
T.J. took the heuristic section.

The AI features 6-ply lookahead and a heuristic function that takes into
account frontier squares and values on a square-by-square basis.  7-ply
would've been nice, but unfortunately it takes too much memory to implement
correctly.
